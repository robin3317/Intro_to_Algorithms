# INTRODUCTION TO ALGORITHM

> Before there were computers, there were algorithms. But now that there are computers, there are even more algorithms, and algorithms lie at the heart of computing.\*

In this repo you will find all the topics related to algorithms and data structures. All things(excluding actual code) are written based on the book - `Introduction to Algorithms`.

**This repo is seperated by chapters, so that you can find and read every chapter very easily.**
